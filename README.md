This is the code repository for [Hands-On Time Series Analysis with R](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-scala-quick-start-guide), published by Packt.

**Perform time series analysis and forecasting using R**

## What is this book about?
Time series analysis is one of the key fields in statistical programming and it comprises of various techniques to analyze data to extract meaningful insights and other valuable characteristics from data. This book will be introducing readers to some powerful methods such as prediction and forecasting with Time Series Analysis using R. The book will equip you with tools and techniques which will let you confidently think through the problem.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get acquainted with JVM-based machine learning libraries for Scala such as Spark ML and Deeplearning4j
* Learn RDDs, DataFrame, and Spark SQL for analyzing structured and unstructured data
* Understand supervised and unsupervised learning techniques with best practices and pitfalls
* Learn classification and regression analysis with linear regression, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and tree-based ensemble techniques
* Learn effective ways of clustering analysis with dimensionality reduction techniques

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
rawTrafficDF.select("Hour (Coded)", "Immobilized bus", "Broken Truck", 
                    "Vehicle excess", "Fire", "Slowness in traffic (%)").show(5)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for machine learning developers looking to train machine learning models in Scala without spending too much time and effort. Some fundamental knowledge of Scala programming and some basics of statistics and linear algebra is all you need to get started with this book.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-7).
